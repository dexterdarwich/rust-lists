# rust-lists
Learn Rust by writing linked lists.

## Background
While learning Rust, I decided to follow this great resource [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).


## A Bad Stack
Singly-Linked Stack, that implements:
* New - Create a new list.
* Push - Push an element onto the stack.
* Pop - Remove an element from the head of the stack.
* Drop - Implemented the drop trait to clean up iteratively.
* Added tests.
